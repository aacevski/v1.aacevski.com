# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to [aacevski.com](https://aacevski.com)!

This is my portfolio website built using Next.js, Chakra UI, Prism, and MDX for the content. The site is deployed on Vercel.

### ðŸš€ Quick Start
1. Clone the repository: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aacevski/aacevski.com.git
```
2. Install dependencies: 
```sh
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env` file by copying the contents of `.env.sample` and replacing the values with your own.

4. Run the development server: `yarn dev`

5. Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
That's it! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me.
