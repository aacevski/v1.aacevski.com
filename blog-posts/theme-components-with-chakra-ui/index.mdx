### What is Chakra UI?
Chakra UI is a component library that allows you to build accessible, reusable, and themeable components.
<br/>

### How to theme components with Chakra UI
There are two types of components in Chakra UI.
Single-part components are components that have a single part, such as a `Button`. 
Multi-part components are components that have multiple parts, such as a `Input`.
<br/>
#### Single-part components

Single part components are those that can be styled as a whole, without the need to target individual parts. Examples of these include buttons, badges, and progress bars. To style these components, you can use the `defineStyle` and `defineStyleConfig` functions imported from `@chakra-ui/react`.

```ts
// src/theme/components/button.ts
import { defineStyle, defineStyleConfig } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const outline = defineStyle({
  border: '2px dashed', // change the appearance of the border
  borderRadius: 0, // remove the border radius
  fontWeight: 'semibold', // change the font weight
})

export const buttonTheme = defineStyleConfig({
  variants: { outline },
})
```

This code defines a `Button` component with two variants, `primary` and `secondary`. You can customize the styles of each variant by adding or modifying the properties in the `variants` object.
<br/>

#### Multi-part components

Multipart components are those that have different parts that need to be styled separately. Examples of these include inputs, checkboxes, and radio buttons. To style these components, you can use the inputAnatomy object imported from `@chakra-ui/anatomy` and the `createMultiStyleConfigHelpers` function imported from `@chakra-ui/react`.
For instance, to style an input, you can use the following code:

```ts
// src/theme/components/input.ts
import { inputAnatomy } from '@chakra-ui/anatomy'
import { createMultiStyleConfigHelpers } from '@chakra-ui/react'

const { definePartsStyle, defineMultiStyleConfig } =
  createMultiStyleConfigHelpers(inputAnatomy.keys)

const baseStyle = definePartsStyle({
  // define the part you're going to style
  field: {
    fontFamily: 'mono', // change the font family
    color: 'teal.500', // change the input text color
  },
  addon: {
    bg: 'gray.100', // change the background color of the addon
  },
})

export const inputTheme = defineMultiStyleConfig({ baseStyle })
```

This code defines an `Input` component with two parts, `field` and `addon`. You can customize the styles of each part by adding or modifying the properties in said part. You can also define variants and default props in the same way as for single part components.

```ts
// src/theme/index.ts
import { extendTheme } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import { inputTheme } from './components/input'
import { buttonTheme } from './components/button'

export const theme = extendTheme({
  components: { 
    Input: inputTheme
    Button: buttonTheme
  },
})
```

And last but not least, you need to add these custom to your `theme` object. You can do this by importing the `extendTheme` function from `@chakra-ui/react` and adding the `components` object to the `theme` object.

### Conclusion
Are you feeling inspired and want to step into the open source world?
If so, you can contribute to Chakra UI by adding theming documentation for [one of the components](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui-docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22created-by%3A+Chakra+UI+team%22).
